Overview 
The To-Do List Web Application is a simple, user-friendly project designed to help users manage their daily tasks. It allows users to add, view, and delete tasks in an organized manner. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application demonstrates fundamental web development principles and provides a solid foundation for beginner developers to learn and expand their skills.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can input tasks into a text field and add them to the to-do list.
View Tasks: Tasks are displayed in a clean, responsive layout.
Delete Tasks: Each task comes with a delete button for easy removal.
Responsive Design: The app is styled to look good on both desktop and mobile devices.

Project Structure
The project contains the following files:
index.html: Contains the structure of the web application.
styles.css (embedded in HTML for simplicity): Provides styling for the app's layout and elements.
script.js (embedded in HTML for simplicity): Contains JavaScript code for dynamic functionality.

How It Works
The user types a task into the input field and clicks the "Add" button.
JavaScript dynamically adds the task to the list displayed below the input field.
Each task has a "Delete" button that removes it from the list when clicked.
The app ensures tasks are not added if the input field is empty.

Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the application.
CSS: For styling and layout.
JavaScript: For adding dynamic functionality like task addition and deletion.

Setup Instructions
Open the index.html file in any web browser to run the app.

Future Enhancements
Task Editing: Allow users to modify existing tasks.
Local Storage: Save tasks so they persist across browser sessions.
Priority Levels: Add functionality to mark tasks with different priority levels.
Completion Status: Allow users to mark tasks as completed.
